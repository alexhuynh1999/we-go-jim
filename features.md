# Features to Add
- The top header needs spacing. Remember that the primary platform is on mobile, so keep in mind things like iPhone notches, cameras, etc.
- Add a timer from when a workout is started to when it finishes. Add some guardrail to prevent super long workouts.
    - In the history section, add a short tag (like the body part tag in exercises) for time like :stopwatch_icon: 1h 30m
- Disable the ability to zoom on the app
- When adding a new set to an exercise, the next exercise should autofill/dimly suggest the same weight/reps as the previous set.
    - Plan it out so we can later implement an algorithm for the next weight/reps
- Move the rest timer to the middle of the screen
- Have the rest timer play a sound (i will upload it, but tell me where to place the audio file)
- Point me towards where I need to place the thumbnail/app icon for this
- API results should capitalize every letter in a new word. Try your best to clean the data (remove punctuation, but keep dashes)
- When a user hits "Finish" on a workout, add a confirmation window.
- When a user clicks a recent workout, it should go straight to the workout, not to the History tab
- add a small version indicator in the header or footer, somewhere discrete but visible
