i want to build a web app with react and any other industry standard libraries.

GOAL: a web app to track workouts. **prioritize the mobile experience**.

TECHSTACK:
- firebase for storing data (or other free alternative)
- github pages

FEATURES:
- logs workouts
    - 3 types of workouts: 
        - FREE WEIGHT 
            - dumbbell
            - barbell
        - BODYWEIGHT
        - MACHINE
    - workouts should generally be recorded as WEIGHT, REPS, and SETS
- a workout template
- a rest timer
- tracking of workout weight. for example, if a user did BENCH PRESS 3 sets of 135x6 one week, next week it should display that in dimmed font. 

TASKS (for this request):
1. generate an AGENTS.md file to keep the repository within bounds
2. generate the implementation plan
