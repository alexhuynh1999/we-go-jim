# React Patterns

## Components

- Functional components only. No class components.
- Use named exports, not default exports.
- One component per file. File name matches component name in PascalCase.

```tsx
// GOOD
export const ExerciseCard = ({ exercise }: ExerciseCardProps) => {
  return <div>...</div>;
};

// BAD - default export
export default function ExerciseCard() { ... }

// BAD - class component
class ExerciseCard extends React.Component { ... }
```

## Hooks

- Custom hooks live in `src/hooks/` and are prefixed with `use`.
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks rather than duplicating in components.
- Keep hooks focused on a single concern.

```tsx
// GOOD - focused hook
export const useRestTimer = (initialSeconds: number) => {
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(initialSeconds);
  // ...timer logic
  return { seconds, start, pause, reset };
};
```

## Component Organization

- Components are organized by feature folder inside `src/components/`.
- Colocate component-specific types in a sibling `*.types.ts` file.
- Shared types go in `src/types/`.

```
src/components/workout/
  ActiveWorkout.tsx
  ActiveWorkout.types.ts
  ExerciseCard.tsx
  SetRow.tsx
```

## State Management

- Use React Context + `useReducer` for complex shared state (e.g., active workout).
- Use `useState` for simple local state.
- Avoid prop drilling more than 2 levels deep -- lift to context instead.

## Event Handlers

- Prefix event handler props with `on` (e.g., `onComplete`, `onSetChange`).
- Prefix handler implementations with `handle` (e.g., `handleComplete`, `handleSetChange`).
